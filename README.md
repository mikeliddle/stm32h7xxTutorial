# STM32H750 Tutorial

This site is a live tutorial for the STM32H750 microcontroller, which is part of the STM32H7 series from STMicroelectronics. These are based on the Cortex M7 core, which gives a lot more performance and expandability than the arduino and esp32 boards commonly used for embedded projects.

Because ST shares a lot of hardware between the different series of their chips, this should work without any issues for other STM32H7 chips, and with minor modification, for other STM32 series of chips.
